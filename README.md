# Credit-Card-Classifier
In this project I implemented a Random Forest Classifier to make a model determining whether an applicant is a risky customer (1) or not (0) based on the applicant's information via the **data.md** file. I used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters to maximize the testing prediction     
We then calculated the metrics listed below:  
**F1 Score**  
**Accuracy**  
**Precision**  
**True Positive Rate**  
**False Positive Rate**  
**Error Rate**  
This program outputted an F1 Score of 0.51, which is an improvement from the previous implemented result of 0.48
