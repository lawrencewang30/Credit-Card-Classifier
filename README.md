# Credit-Card-Classifier
In this project I implemented a Random Forest Classifier to make a model determining whether an applicant is a risky customer (1) or not (0) based on the applicant's information via the **data.md** file.     
We then calculated the following metrics listed below:  
**F1 Score**  
**Accuracy**  
**Precision**  
**True Positive Rate**  
**False Positive Rate**  
**Error Rate**  
Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, where I achieved an F1
score of 0.51 and 92.4% accuracy  
Enhanced prediction accuracy through systematic hyperparameter adjustments and rigorous
model evaluation, leading to consistent performance improvements
